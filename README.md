# Command-Line Mastermind
Simple command-line mastermind game created with Ruby.

## Introduction
This project, as [part of The Odin Project's "Ruby Programming" module](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/mastermind), is an attempt at developing a command-line mastermind game adhering strictly to the newly learned principles of object-oriented programming. The game's AI can act as both the code-maker and the code-breaker, giving players the option of choosing their own role against the AI.

## Technologies

* Ruby 2.7.2
