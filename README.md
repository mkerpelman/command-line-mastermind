# Command-Line Mastermind
Simple command-line mastermind game created with Ruby.

## Introduction
This project, as [part of The Odin Project's "Ruby Programming" module](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/full-stack-ruby-on-rails/courses/ruby-programming/lessons/mastermind), is an attempt at developing a command-line mastermind game adhering strictly to the newly learned principles of object-oriented programming. The game's AI can act as both the code-maker and the code-breaker, giving players the option of choosing their own role against the AI.

## Technologies

* Ruby 2.7.2

## Launch

To run this project, call it from the home directory of the repository through the command line:

```shell
ruby lib/main.rb
```
## To-Do & Limitations

* The AI algorithm in codemaker mode occasionally diverges and causes the entire game to crash, indicating it stands to be significantly improved. The priority of this fix is low at this time, as the goal of the project has been to enact the principles of object-oriented programming to put together a coherent, organized program as opposed to focusing on algorithms.
